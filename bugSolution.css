To resolve issues with `calc()`, ensure proper order of operations using parentheses and consistent units throughout the calculation. For example, to calculate a width that is 100% of the container minus 20 pixels, you should write it as: `width: calc(100% - 20px);`  If you intend to perform calculations with different units, use consistent units or employ explicit unit conversion to avoid unexpected behavior. If your issue persists, make sure the parent container's dimensions are correctly defined and that there are no conflicting styles affecting the element's width.
